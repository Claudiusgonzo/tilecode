## State

The TileCode state is the tile map populated with sprites. Each tile has one of four possible backgrounds, which can change during
an execution. A tile may contain zero, one or more sprites. There are four kinds of sprites. A sprite's kind is fixed for the 
lifetime of the sprite (from creation to destruction). A sprite has a direction (up, down, left, right, resting), indicating the way
the sprite moved in the last round, or if it remained at rest.
