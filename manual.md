# Introduction

TileCode is a game creation app that allows you to design and play games directly on MakeCode Arcade devices. 
TileCode games are similar to board games with pieces that can move from one tile of the board to a nearby tile. 

# Install and Run

You can run TileCode in a web browser (see Arcade simulator at bottom of this screen) or 
on any [MakeCode Arcade device](https://arcade.makecode.com/hardware). Click on
the **UF2 File** link at the very bottom of the screen to download the latest TileCode
UF2 file to your computer. Plug your Arcade device into your computer via a USB cable.
Copy this file to your Arcade device to get started (this one file works for all 
MakeCode Arcade compatible devices).
