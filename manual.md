# Introduction

TileCode is a game creation app that allows you to design and play games directly on MakeCode Arcade devices. 
TileCode games are similar to board games with pieces that can move from one tile of the board to a nearby tile. 

# Install and Run

You can run TileCode in a [web browser](https://microsoft.github.io/tilecode/), or 
on any [MakeCode Arcade device](https://arcade.makecode.com/hardware) - copy this 
[UF2 file](https://github.com/microsoft/tilecode/releases/download/v4.2.2/arcade.uf2) 
to your device to get started (works for all MakeCode Arcade devices) after you 
connect your device to a computer via an USB cable.
