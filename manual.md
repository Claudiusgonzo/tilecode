## Introduction and Videos

TileCode is a game creation app that allows you to design and play games directly 
on [MakeCode Arcade](https://arcade.makecode.com){:target="_blank"} devices (or in a web browser). 
TileCode games are similar to board games with pieces that can move from one tile of the board to a nearby tile. Click on the images below to watch a short video (left) and longer video (right) about TileCode:
